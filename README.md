# Sudoku

This app lets you create, play, and solve Sudoku puzzles.


## Goals

This project serves as a way to learn new technologies and showcase how I work,
but feel free to explore and scavenge any code you find useful.

-Learning
  -Get more comfortable with TypeScript to replace JSDoc. 
  -Learn NextJS and the T3 stack using [`create-t3-app`](https://create.t3.gg/)


## Next Steps

- Model
  - group possible cells hold index sets instead of point sets for performance?
- Play
  - UI
    - undo/redo
    - show clear errors
    - highlight knowns/possibles when solved cell is selected
    - inspect/apply solvers
- Create
  - manual partial puzzles
  - random puzzles
